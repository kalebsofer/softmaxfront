          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-6">Change to the Data Protection Law</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The law in relation to data protection has changed from May 2018. This Privacy Notice has been written to reflect your new rights and to explain how we process your personal data.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            You should read through this Privacy Notice to fully understand the basis upon which we collect your personal data, how we use it, where we store it and to whom it is disclosed.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We are dedicated to keeping your data safe and complying with applicable data protection legislation.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-6">Your Rights</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            By law, you have a number of rights when it comes to your personal data. Further information and advice about your rights can be obtained from the data protection regulator in your country, in the UK this is the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). These rights include:
          </p>

          <ol className="list-decimal list-outside ml-6 mb-4 space-y-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Right to be informed:</strong> You have the right to be provided with clear, transparent and easily understandable information about how we use your personal data and your rights. This is why we're providing you with the information in this Notice.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Right of access:</strong> You have the right to access your personal data and supplementary information. This allows you to be aware of and verify the lawfulness of the processing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Right to rectification:</strong> You are entitled to have your data corrected if it is inaccurate or incomplete.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Right to erasure:</strong> The right to erasure is also known as 'the right to be forgotten'. It enables you to request the deletion or removal of your personal data where there's no compelling reason for us to keep processing it. This is not a general right to erasure; under certain circumstances we will need to continue processing your data in spite of a request for its deletion.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Right to restrict processing:</strong> You have the right to request the restriction or suppression of your personal data. However, this is not an absolute right and only applies in certain circumstances. When processing is restricted, we can still store your personal data, but may not use it further.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Right to data portability:</strong> This allows you to obtain and reuse your personal data for your own purposes across different services. It allows you to move, copy or transfer personal data easily from one IT environment to another in a safe and secure way.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Right to object:</strong> You have the right to object to processing for direct marketing (which we will only do with your consent) and also to processing which is carried out for the purposes of our legitimate interests.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Rights related to automated decision making including profiling:</strong> This allows you to object to any decision based solely on automated processing and you can request the chance to have a decision considered by a human so that they are able to express their point of view, or challenge the decision.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Right to lodge a complaint:</strong> You have the right to lodge a complaint about the way we handle or process your personal data with your national data protection regulator.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Right to withdraw consent:</strong> If you have given your consent to anything we do with your personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time (although It's important to note that the withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal). This includes your right to withdraw consent to us using your personal data for marketing purposes.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p className="mb-4">
            We are required by law to act on requests and provide information free of charge, except where your requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive (in particular because of their repetitive nature) in which case we may charge a reasonable fee (taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication, or taking the action requested), or refuse to act on the request.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Please consider your request responsibly before submitting it. We'll respond as soon as we can.
